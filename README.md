#### correction 
The manager think I don't fit the requirement for the front end developer job, mostly because the sementic HTML and
some others consideration.
They want to see others candidates more qualify.
- a name of my functions was wrong in Javascript: **threeModules()** I update to **changeThreeModules()**
- the list was wrap in div, I replaced the div by a list **ul>li**
- I add a footer and an icon mostly for fun ðŸ˜œ
- I didn't really know why I have in script element, it's mostly avoid
  text/javascript, text it's for human and application for no human, I didn't
know the relation with doctype html 5 
 <script type="application/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
