### Assignment

Programming problem for Xavier.

Build a responsive module on a webpage containing 4 square boxes with colors: red, green, blue, white. Each box has a maximum width of 230px, and the webpage has a maximum width of 980px. Each box contains a button, and when clicked changes the color of the other buttons to its color, except for the white box. The white box always remains white and when its button is clicked, it resets the colors of the other boxes to their original colors.

### Correction ðŸ”¥
The manager had suggestions for my code.
- Some names of my functions was difficult to read. I renamed them for more visibility: **threeModules()** to **changeThreeModules()**,  **whiteModule** to **resetWhiteButton** and the class html **.btn-white** to **.btn-reset** 
- the list was wrapped in div, I replaced the div by a list **ul>li**, for semantic reason and therefor I add reset CSS on the list
- I completely forgot the relation between Doctype and the type="...", I was using the doctype html5 and always assume it was type="application/javascript" I knew the type="text/javascript" was obsolete in modern browser(text seems to be read by human), once on my computer I realized I knew the answer, I just completely forgot
- The **box-sizing: content-box** wasn't clear at the moment, I was confuse with margin and
  padding with border, maybe the stress, basically I reversed the answer
- I didn't aggree, with this critic: 
  1. the container with a width:100% is unnecassary and a mistake: 
  2. false statement because this style property is necessary to fill the screen in mobile and it
     helps to have a better design experience
- I added a footer and an icon mostly for fun ðŸ˜œ

#### I learned a lot of things and therefore it was a rewarding experience
